\chapter{Principles of operation}

This chapter provides a brief overview of the basic operating principles of electric permanent magnet
synchronous motors, and the relevant approaches and solutions implemented in Sapog.

\section{PMSM and BLDC motors}

\subsection{Basic equations}\label{sec:motor_equations}

This section provides the most important equations that describe a DC electric motor.
The principles explained here can be extended to all types of polyphase PMSM motors as well.

In the context of electric drives, BEMF is the voltage induced on the motor windings
while the armature of the motor is moving relative to the magnetic field of the rotor.
The induced voltage can be observed on the phase leads of the motor.
The magnitude of the induced voltage is dependent on the speed of the armature relative to the magnetic field
of the rotor, and the magnetic flux linkage of the motor. The dependency can be expressed as follows:
\begin{equation}
E_b = \phi \omega_e
\end{equation}
where $E_b$ $\left[\text{volt}\right]$ is the induced back electromotive force,
$\phi$ $\left[\text{weber}\right]$ is the magnetic flux linkage,
and $\omega_e$ $\left[\frac{\text{radian}}{\text{second}}\right]$ is the electrical angular velocity.

Electrical angular velocity is a function of the mechanical angular velocity
$\omega_m$ $\left[\frac{\text{radian}}{\text{second}}\right]$
and the number of rotor magnetic poles $N_p$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:speed_electrical_mechanical}
\omega_e = \frac{\omega_m N_p}{2}\qquad
N_p \geq 2, N_p\text{\ is even}
\end{equation}

Both mechanical and electrical angular velocity are related to the mechanical and electrical RPM,
respectively, as follows:
\begin{equation}
\text{RPM} = \frac{30 \omega }{\pi }
\end{equation}

The armature current $I_a$ $\left[\text{ampere}\right]$ is proportional to
the voltage difference between the induced back EMF and
the source voltage $E_s$ $\left[\text{volt}\right]$:
\begin{equation}
I_a = \frac{E_s - E_b}{R}
\end{equation}
where $R$ $\left[\text{ohm}\right]$ is the internal resistance of the stator.

Torque $\tau$ $\left[\text{newton}\cdot{}\text{meter}\right]$ observed on the shaft is dependent on the
torque-generating current, flux linkage, and the number of rotor magnetic poles as follows:
\begin{equation}
\tau = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} I_a N_p \phi
\end{equation}

Mechanical power output $P$ $\left[\text{watt}\right]$
is the product of torque and mechanical angular velocity:
\begin{equation}
P = \tau \omega_m
\end{equation}

Motor velocity constant $K_V$ $\left[\frac{\text{RPM}_m}{\text{volt}}\right]$
is sometimes used in marketing materials and motor specifications
instead of magnetic flux linkage.\footnote{Sometimes $K_V$ is written as KV, although
this form is discouraged because it can be confused with kilovolt (kV).}
This is not a SI quantity, so its use is generally discouraged.
It can be expressed via the magnetic flux linkage $\phi$
and the number of rotor magnetic poles $N_p$ as follows:
\begin{equation}
K_V = \frac{20 \sqrt{3}}{\pi  N_p \phi }
\end{equation}

\subsection{BEMF shape}

There are two major types of permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSM) that differ by the shape of the back
electromotive force induced while the rotor is moving at a constant speed.

The first type has a fixed magnetic flux linkage that is independent of the electrical position of the rotor.
The induced BEMF per phase therefore has a sinusoidal shape.
These motors are typically referred to simply as PMSM, or BLAC.
Since the term PMSM is quite ambiguous, we will be using the term BLAC to refer to a PMSM with sine shaped BEMF.

The other type, referred to as brushless DC, or BLDC, has a variable flux linkage that changes with the
rotor position in a specific way that results in the trapezoidal shape of the back EMF.
The difference is illustrated on the figure \ref{bemf_trapezoidal_vs_sinusoidal}.

\begin{figure}[hbt]
    \centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{bemf_trapezoidal_vs_sinusoidal}
	\caption{Difference between trapezoidal and sinusoidal BEMF.
	\label{bemf_trapezoidal_vs_sinusoidal}}
\end{figure}

Sapog, being a BLDC drive, drives the motor with trapezoidal modulated voltage.
This produces smooth torque and vibration free operation with BLDC motors,
since it is expected that the flux linkage will be changing in a specific way.

Like any BLDC drive, Sapog can operate with BLAC motors as well, albeit with increased torque ripple.
From the model presented in section \ref{sec:motor_equations} we can predict that the motor
will exhibit periodic variations in the output torque if the form of the voltage modulated by the controller
does not match with the form of the back EMF induced in the motor.
The resulting periodic torque variations that occur in a BLAC motor driven by a BLDC drive
(and, likewise, in a BLDC motor driven with sine modulated voltages) are shown on the figure 
\ref{sine_torque_deviation}.

\begin{figure}[hbt]
    \centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{sine_torque_deviation}
	\caption{Torque ripple caused by mismatching forms of the back EMF and the source voltage.
	\label{sine_torque_deviation}}
\end{figure}

Many applications, however, can tolerate the induced torque ripple and associated vibrations produced
by the motor.

\section{Motor control}

\subsection{Commutation sequence}

\newcommand{\BEMFH}{$\uparrow$}
\newcommand{\BEMFL}{$\downarrow$}

Three phase BLDC drives operate by modulating a specific sequence of voltages on the motor phases
synchronously with the movement of the rotor.
The modulated voltage sequences are shown in the commutation table below
(legend: $+$ -- positive voltage output; $-$ -- negative voltage output;
\BEMFH{} -- the phase is floating, induced BEMF is rising;
\BEMFL{} -- the phase is floating, induced BEMF is falling).

\begin{tabu}{|l c|c c c c c c|}
    \hline
    \rowfont{\bfseries}
    \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{\diagbox{Phase}{Step}}
                                 & 0     & 1     & 2     & 3     & 4     & 5     \\\hline
    \multirow{3}{*}{Forward} & A & $-$   &\BEMFH & $+$   & $+$   &\BEMFL & $-$   \\
                             & B & $+$   & $+$   &\BEMFL & $-$   & $-$   &\BEMFH \\
                             & C &\BEMFL & $-$   & $-$   &\BEMFH & $+$   & $+$   \\\hline
    \multirow{3}{*}{Reverse} & A & $-$   &\BEMFH & $+$   & $+$   &\BEMFL & $-$   \\
                             & B &\BEMFL & $-$   & $-$   &\BEMFH & $+$   & $+$   \\
                             & C & $+$   & $+$   &\BEMFL & $-$   & $-$   &\BEMFH \\\hline
\end{tabu}

The choice between forward and reverse commutation tables affects the direction of rotation of the motor,
and it is specified via the configuration parameter \CfgRef{ctl+dir}.

The rotor position is deduced from the behavior of the induced BEMF on the floating phase.
From figure \ref{bemf_trapezoidal_vs_sinusoidal} we can deduce that when the induced BEMF of the floating
phase crosses the median voltage between the high and the low phase, there is 30 electrical degrees left
before the next commutation step begins.
The controller employs this rule to estimate the time when the next commutation should occur.
The process is demonstrated on the figure \ref{commutation_basics}.
The voltage waveforms shown on the figure were acquired from the phase voltage signal conditioning circuits,
before the ADC inputs, shown on the figure \ref{power_stage_schematic}.

\begin{figure}[hbt]
    \centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{commutation_basics}
	\caption{Six step commutation sequence observed through phase voltages.
	\label{commutation_basics}}
	PWM modulation is not seen because the shown voltages were acquired while the controller
	was operating at full duty cycle.
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[hbt]
    \centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{power_stage_schematic}
	\caption{Simplified schematic of the VSI and BEMF feedback circuits that Sapog relies on.
	\label{power_stage_schematic}}
\end{figure}

From the section \ref{sec:motor_equations} we know that the magnitude of the induced BEMF is linearly
dependent on the speed of relative motion between the armature and the rotor magnetic field.
Considering also the fact that the controller relies on the induced BEMF signal for rotor position estimation,
we can predict that the rotor position estimation may be unreliable if the induced BEMF is not sufficiently
strong.
In order to avoid issues at low speed operation, Sapog provides several configuration parameters that
restrict the minimum operating speed, such as the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item \CfgRef{mot+comm+per+max} - maximum commutation period, in microseconds.
The estimated commutation period will be artificially constrained to not exceed this value.
\item \CfgRef{mot+rpm+min} - minimum RPM that can be demanded in RPM governor mode.
If the demanded RPM is lower, the setpoint will be artificially increased.
Reduce this parameter to make the minimum speed lower; increase it to improve stability.
\item \CfgRef{mot+v+min} - minimum source voltage when operating in open loop mode, in volts.
If the demanded duty cycle amounts to a lower source voltage than this, the setpoint will be artificially
increased.
Reduce this parameter to make the minimum speed lower; increase it to improve stability.
\end{itemize}

These parameters may need adjustment to make Sapog compatible with a specific motor.
For example, if the motor cannot keep stable operation at low speed,
the minimum source voltage should be increased,
and/or the maximum commutation period should be made longer.
The minimum voltage limit does not apply to RPM loop mode,
where the minimum speed is governed by the dedicated configuration parameter shown above.

The following equation can be used to convert between commutation period $T_\text{comm}$
$\left[\text{second}\right]$
and electrical angular velocity $\omega_e$ $\left[\frac{\text{radian}}{\text{second}}\right]$:
\begin{equation}
\omega_e = \frac{\pi}{3 T_\text{comm}}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Source voltage modulation}

Source voltage modulation technique employed by Sapog is a fixed carrier frequency, fixed dead time,
4-quadrant, simultaneous complementary switching PWM modulation.
This modulation technique supports active freewheeling and regenerative braking.

Reviewing different modulation techniques would be outside of the scope of this document.
For more background, the reader is advised to refer to other sources, such as the article
``Influence of PWM Schemes and Commutation Methods for DC and Brushless Motors and Drives''
(Dal Y. Ohm, Richard J. Oleksuk).

The following configuration parameters govern operation of the source voltage modulator:
\begin{itemize}
\item \CfgRef{mot+pwm+hz} - PWM carrier frequency, in hertz.
\item \CfgRef{mot+pwm+dt+ns} - PWM switching dead time, in nanoseconds.
It is not recommended to change this value from the default,
unless there is full understanding of the matter.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Field weakening}

From section \ref{sec:motor_equations} we know that the maximum speed that a motor can achieve is dependent
on the the load, magnetic flux linkage, and the source voltage.
Reduction of the magnetic flux linkage decreases the induced BEMF, which allows the rotor reach higher speed,
given constant source voltage and load.

The controller can alter the commutation sequence in a specific way, causing the rotating magnetic field
created by the stator to interact with the magnetic field of the rotor in a way that reduces the magnetic
field linkage, effectively increasing the maximum speed of the rotor, reducing the output torque,
while keeping the maximum mechanical power output constant.
Note that since part of the energy is expended on suppression of the magnetic fields induced by the rotor,
the overall efficiency of the drive decreases with higher field weakening.

This technique is known as \emph{field weakening}, and it is implemented by means of adjustment of the 
commutation sequence, shortening the time interval from the zero crossing point to the moment when the next
commutation step begins.
In the context of BLDC drives this specific approach is also known as \emph{commutation advancing}.

Sapog defines commutation advance angle in electrical angular degrees of rotor position,
and it can vary from 0\degree{} to 29\degree{}, inclusively, where 0\degree{} corresponds to no advance,
and 29\degree{} corresponds to the maximum advance angle.
The practical effects imposed on the drive are summarized in the following table.

\begin{ZubaxCompactTable}{|c|c c c c|}
    Advance angle & Flux linkage & Maximum torque & Maximum speed & Drive efficiency \\
    Low           & High         & High           & Low           & High             \\
    High          & Low          & Low            & High          & Low              \\
\end{ZubaxCompactTable}

Sapog can modulate a fixed advance angle, or it can be defined as a function of speed.
The latter is especially useful, since high field weakening at low speeds does not make practical sense,
and serves only to reduce the drive efficiency with no apparent benefit to the application.
Additionally, high field weakening may be responsible for stability issues at low operating speeds,
because it effectively reduces the magnitude of the BEMF induced in the motor.

The field weakening feature is configured with the help of the following configuration parameters:

\begin{itemize}
\item \CfgRef{mot+tim+adv+max} - maximum commutation advance angle, in electrical rotor position degrees.
\item \CfgRef{mot+tim+adv+min} - minimum commutation advance angle, same units.
\item \CfgRef{mot+tim+cp+min} - when the current commutation period is longer than this value,
the minimum advance angle will be used. The units are microseconds.
\item \CfgRef{mot+tim+cp+max} - when the current commutation period is shorter than this value,
the maximum advance angle will be used. Same units.
\end{itemize}

When the current commutation period is between \verb|mot_tim_cp_max| and \verb|mot_tim_cp_min|,
the advance angle will be proportionally linearly interpolated between
\verb|mot_tim_adv_min| and \verb|mot_tim_adv_max|.
The interpolation logic is demonstrated on the figure \ref{timing_advance_interpolation_plot}.

\begin{figure}[hbt]
    \centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{timing_advance_interpolation_plot}
	\caption{Timing advance interpolation logic.
	\label{timing_advance_interpolation_plot}}
\end{figure}

Sample phase voltage waveforms acquired while the controller was operating under high field
weakening settings are shown on the figure \ref{phase_voltages_at_high_advance_angle}.

\begin{figure}[hbtp]
    \centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{phase_voltages_at_high_advance_angle}
	\caption{Commutation sequence at high advance angle settings.
	\label{phase_voltages_at_high_advance_angle}}
	It can be seen that the next commutation begins shortly after the induced BEMF
	crosses the neutral voltage.
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Freewheeling considerations}

Upon careful review of the field weakening effect it might become obvious that it poses certain danger
when the motor is operating at a high speed.

According to the explanations above, as long as the field weakening is active,
the controller actively suppresses the excessive flux of the permanent magnets in the rotor.
This suppression allows the controller to lower the induced BEMF, and, therefore,
extend the operating speed upwards, while keeping the source voltage constant.

Consider what happens when the inverter (or the controller as a whole) is turned off while the
motor was running with the rotor field weakened.
As the controller ceases to suppress the field, the flux linkage of the motor returns to nominal,
which, given that the speed is sufficiently high, may significantly exceed the inverter supply
voltage $V_\text{inv}$, possibly causing damage to the controller, the power supply, the motor, etc.

\subsection{Rotor state observer}

\subsubsection{BEMF processing}

As mentioned previously, Sapog deduces the current position of the rotor by tracking the induced BEMF
on the floating phase.
Which phase is floating and the direction in which BEMF is changing is dependent on the current electrical
angle of the rotor.

Measurement of the induced BEMF is done by the ADC, which is connected to the motor phases via
resistive voltage dividers which reduce the dynamic range of the motor phase voltages into a narrower
dynamic range acceptable by the ADC,
and a buffer capacitor that provides fast recharge of the sample-and-hold capacitor of the ADC,
and suppresses high frequency noise.
The resulting simplified schematic can be seen on the figure \ref{power_stage_schematic}.

BEMF measurements are sensitive to noise. In order to avoid interference with the noise generated
by the VSI, the controller synchronizes BEMF sampling with PWM switching.
However, the timing resolution provided by the resulting sampling pattern is insufficient for robust
rotor state estimation because of the sampling period restrictions imposed by the
PWM carrier frequency.

In order to work around this limitation, Sapog collects a number of samples, and,
knowing that the shape of the BEMF induced by the floating phase of a BLDC motor is linear,
solves a linear regression problem on the collected samples, effectively recovering the most likely
shape of the BEMF signal.
The resulting approximation is very robust and resilient to noise.

The principle is illustrated on the figure \ref{phase_voltage_sampling}.

\begin{figure}[hbtp]
    \centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{phase_voltage_sampling}
	\caption{BEMF sampling and PWM modulation.
	\label{phase_voltage_sampling}}
\end{figure}

The number of BEMF samples $N_\text{samples}$ included in the linear regression is defined by
the configuration parameter \CfgRef{mot+bemf+win+den} (dimensionless) as follows:
\begin{equation}
N_\text{samples} =
\frac{T_{\text{comm}} F_{\text{pwm}}}{\frac{\alpha\cdot{}\Pi_\text{bemfwinden}}{15} + \Pi_\text{bemfwinden}} + 2
\end{equation}
where $T_{\text{comm}}$ is the current commutation period,
$\Pi_\text{bemfwinden}$ is the value of the configuration parameter,
$\alpha$ is the current commutation advance angle in electrical rotor position degrees,
and $F_{\text{pwm}}$ $\left[\text{hertz}\right]$ is the PWM carrier frequency.

An attentive reader might point out that the assumption of linear BEMF that the described method rests
upon does not hold for BLAC motors, since the induced BEMF of a floating phase will be sinusoidal rather
than linear.
While the objection is correct, this deviation does not pose a significant problem, since the sinusoidal
BEMF well approximates to linear near the point of zero crossing.
Some issues may arise at very high advance angles, where the controller will be forced to resort to
look-ahead extrapolation, so that the linear regression will be applied to the sample set acquired
at the point where the linear approximation assumption does not hold.
The resulting imprecision, however, should not be of significant practical importance.

\subsubsection{Special cases}

The figure \ref{phase_voltage_sampling_corner_cases} provides a closer look at the challenges
seen by the controller in certain operating modes, which are reviewed below.

\begin{figure}[hbtp]
    \centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{phase_voltages_braking_high_advance_angle}
	\caption{Corner cases of BEMF sampling.
	\label{phase_voltage_sampling_corner_cases}}
\end{figure}

In certain operating modes the induced BEMF of the floating phase may briefly exceed the
inverter supply voltage $V_\text{inv}$, or fall below the ground level,
causing voltage drop on either the high-side or low-side flyback diodes, respectively.
BEMF samples acquired at this time are not representative of the true form of the signal,
because the signal is altered by external factors;
and therefore, such samples cannot be used for the linear regression.
Sapog uses a simple heuristic that allows it to detect when the sampled signal is subjected to
altering and discard the affected samples.
The heuristic checks whether the sampled voltage falls into a specified range near the neutral voltage,
and discards the sample if it doesn't.

Additionally, samples acquired shortly after commutation may be subjected to transient distortions.
Sapog works around that by imposing a fixed \emph{blanking time} after a commutation, during which
BEMF sampling is not performed.

The following configuration parameters are relevant to the reviewed aspects:

\begin{itemize}
\item \CfgRef{mot+bemf+range} - the voltage range around neutral,
in percent of the inverter supply voltage $V_\text{inv}$, where the BEMF samples
will be considered valid and accepted into the solution.
\item \CfgRef{mot+blank+usec} - duration of the blanking time after the commutation, in microseconds.
\item \CfgRef{mot+spup+blnk+pm} - minimum blanking time during spin-up, permill of the commutation period.
This parameter is reviewed in more detail in a dedicated section.
\end{itemize}

Additional difficulties are posed by operation at very high power levels,
and/or when the controlled motor exhibits high inductance of the windings.
Under these conditions, the motor windings tend to accumulate significant energy during the duration
of the commutation period.
When the current commutation period ends, the winding is released, but the accumulated energy maintains
some current through the winding and the \emph{flyback diode} of one of the transistors until
the energy is dissipated.
This current caused by the energy release from a disconnected inductive network is known as
\emph{flyback current}.
As long as the flyback current is flowing though the winding and the flyback diode,
the induced BEMF is completely suppressed and, therefore,
is unobservable, which does not allow the controller to evaluate the state of the rotor.

\begin{figure}[hbtp]
    \centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{phase_voltages_at_high_load}
	\caption{Challenges of high power operation.
	\label{phase_voltages_at_high_load}}
\end{figure}

Sapog recognizes this condition and waits for the flyback current to cease.
If the current is still flowing past a certain deadline necessary for the controller to evaluate the
point of zero crossing, Sapog enters a \emph{desaturation mode} in order to bring the system
back into observable state.
In the desaturation mode Sapog turns off the inverter and waits until the next commutation period.
By the time the next commutation period begins, the flyback currents will have ended,
allowing the controller to continue observation of the motor state.

The figure \ref{phase_voltages_at_high_load} shows operation near the point of activation
of the desaturation mode.

\subsubsection{Maximum speed restrictions}

It is easy to see that as the speed increases and the commutation period shortens,
the number of BEMF samples that can be accommodated within the commutation period will be decreasing.
This effect imposes the limit on the maximum achievable speed, and the limit is dependent on the PWM
carrier frequency.

When the drive operates in open loop mode, the controller will limit the maximum duty cycle
when the commutation period reaches dangerously low values.
The limiting is done by means of a simple P-controller,
which begins to override the duty cycle setpoint when it exceeds a certain value.

When the drive operates in RPM control loop mode, the limiting will be performed simply by means of
clipping the RPM setpoint.

The exact thresholds are specified on the figure \ref{pwm_maximum_speed}.

The configuration parameter \CfgRef{mot+pwm+hz} can be used to set the desirable PWM frequency
in hertz.
It is recommended to keep the frequency as low as possible,
as that would facilitate lower switching losses and therefore higher efficiency of the drive.

\begin{figure}[hbt]
    \centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{pwm_maximum_speed}
	\caption{Dependency of the maximum speed on PWM frequency.
	\label{pwm_maximum_speed}}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Field weakening restrictions}

The controller requires several microseconds to solve the linear regression problem after the sampling is
finished.
However, operation at very high advance angles requires the controller to perform commutation virtually
immediately after the zero crossing has happened, leaving very little time to perform the computation.
The controller strives to work around this contradiction by trying to robustly extrapolate the shape of the
BEMF signal, predicting the upcoming zero crossing ahead of time.

Despite that, operation at very high speeds may not provide the time necessary to take a sufficient
number of samples and solve the regression problem before the next commutation is due.
In this case, Sapog will silently lower the current advance angle and keep it at as close to the requested
value as the current operating mode permits.

\subsection{Regenerative braking}

During regenerative braking, the source voltage $E_s$ modulated by the controller is lower than the
induced BEMF $E_b$, which causes reverse current flow from the motor into the VSI
and further into the power supply network.
According to the formulas presented in the section \ref{sec:motor_equations},
reversing the current will also reverse the torque, causing the motor to rapidly decelerate.

This process converts the mechanical energy of the motor into electrical energy returned back into the
power supply network.
If the power supply network cannot absorb the recovered energy (e.g. due to its resistance being too high),
the regenerative energy transfer may lead to increase of the supply voltage beyond the safe operating limits.
Typically, the controller hardware is equipped with some protection circuits that activate and dissipate the
excessive energy when $V_\text{inv}$ increases a certain threshold;
however, their energy absorption capabilities are often very  limited.

Generally, batteries are capable of absorbing the regenerated energy during braking without issues.
Problems may arise if the controller is powered from a source that does not permit reverse currents,
such as laboratory power supplies or some types of voltage conversion circuits.

Refer to the documentation provided with your hardware to learn more about the issues
concerning regenerative braking and the excess energy release.

\subsection{Rotor stall detection}\label{sec:stall_detection}

Rotor stall is a condition where the rotor ceases to rotate due to the torque generated by the motor
being lower than the mechanical load on the shaft.
Sapog detects this condition by observing a specific number of failures to find
a valid BEMF zero crossing event.

As explained in one of the earlier sections of this document,
Sapog requires the rotor to move in order to be able to operate normally.
Once the rotor has stalled, Sapog will shut down the VSI and wait for the next setpoint to arrive.
Once the next setpoint has arrived, Sapog will restart the motor normally,
unless the number of consecutive stalls has exceeded a specific limit.

In the latter case, Sapog will lock up and refuse to start the motor again,
until it has received a zero setpoint.
Zero setpoint is treated as a reset command that clears the stall counter and unlocks the controller.

Zero cross failures are counted with the help of a dedicated counter state.
When Sapog fails to find a zero crossing solution,
the failure counter is incremented by one.
When Sapog succeeds to perform six (6) commutations in a row without failures,
the failure counter is reset back to zero.

The following configuration parameters configure the behaviors pertaining to stall detection:

\begin{itemize}
\item \CfgRef{mot+zc+fails+max} - zero crossing detection failure threshold.
If the failure counter exceeds this threshold, the rotor will be considered stalled.
\item \CfgRef{mot+stop+thres} - lock-up threshold.
If the rotor has stalled this number of times in a row,
the controller will lock up until a zero setpoint is received.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Spin-up}

As has been explained before, Sapog requires the rotor to move in order to be able to operate normally,
because the state estimation methods that work well when the rotor is moving break apart when the rotor is
stationary or nearly so.

From the above follows that a different method of state estimation is needed to start the motor
from standstill, especially so if the shaft is attached to a mechanical/inertial load.

\subsubsection{Algorithm}

When starting the motor, Sapog sets the source voltage $E_s$ to the value specified in the
configuration parameter \CfgRef{mot+v+spinup}, and activates the commutation step at the index 1.
Having done so, Sapog begins to wait for the zero crossing detector to report that it is time to
begin the next commutation period, or until the amount of time specified by the configuration parameter
\CfgRef{mot+spup+st+cp} expires, whichever happens first.
Afterwards, Sapog switches to the next commutation step, and the process repeats again.

While in spin-up mode, Sapog will slowly increase the voltage from the initial value specified
by \CfgRef{mot+v+spinup} until the minimal operating voltage \CfgRef{mot+v+min} is reached.
The duration of the spin-up voltage ramp is specified by the parameter \CfgRef{mot+spup+vramp+t},
in seconds.
The ramp is graphically illustrated on the image \ref{spinup_voltage_ramp}.

\begin{figure}[hbt]
    \centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{spinup_voltage_ramp}
	\caption{Voltage ramp during spin-up.
	\label{spinup_voltage_ramp}}
\end{figure}

It should be noted that high initial voltages and/or steep voltage ramps need to be avoided,
because they may lead to severe instabilities in the beginning of the spin-up sequence.
Keep in mind that it is virtually impossible for any synchronous sensorless drive to create stable
torque at low speeds, and especially at standstill.

While spin-up is in progress, Sapog always operates at the zero advance angle
(field weakening disabled) for the reasons explained earlier,
regardless of the configured advance angle settings.

\subsubsection{Spin-up rotor state observer}

The zero crossing detector mentioned above operates in a very different way compared to the
normal rotor state observer used in the normal operating mode.

While operating in spin-up mode, the observable behavior of the induced BEMF may be very erratic,
mainly due to the low magnitude of the signal and irregular rotation of the rotor caused by
imprecise synchronization of the modulated field with the field of the rotor.
In order to combat these difficulties, Sapog employs a different kind of observer, which provides
more robust operation at low speeds.

Immediately after commutation Sapog inserts a blanking delay $T_\text{blank}$
defined by the following equation:
\begin{equation}
T_{\text{blank}}=
\max \left(\frac{\Pi_{\text{blankusec}}}{10^6},
\frac{\Pi_{\text{spupblnkpm}} T_{\text{comm}}}{1000}\right)
\end{equation}
where $\Pi_{\text{spupblnkpm}}$ is the value of the configuration parameter \CfgRef{mot+spup+blnk+pm}
(permill of the commutation period),
$T_{\text{comm}}$ is the duration of the last commutation period,
$\Pi_{\text{blankusec}}$ is the value of the configuration parameter \CfgRef{mot+blank+usec}
(in microseconds).

Upon expiration of the blanking delay, Sapog watches the BEMF waiting for the flyback current to cease.
Afterwards, Sapog starts to integrate the sampled BEMF voltages relative to the neutral voltage.
Once the integrated voltage changes the sign, Sapog switches to the next commutation period.
A more formal definition of the commutation condition is shown below:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
&\sum_{n} E_{s_n} - E_{\text{neutral}_n} > 0 \qquad\text{for rising BEMF}\\
&\sum_{n} E_{s_n} - E_{\text{neutral}_n} < 0 \qquad\text{for falling BEMF}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The principle is illustrated on the oscillogram \ref{spinup_phase_voltages}.

\begin{figure}[hbt]
    \centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{spinup_phase_voltages}
	\caption{Spin-up sequence with a highly inertial load.
	\label{spinup_phase_voltages}}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Termination conditions}

Spin-up will be considered finished once the maximum commutation period defined by the parameter
\CfgRef{mot+comm+per+max} \emph{and} the minimum voltage \CfgRef{mot+v+min} are reached.
Should the target commutation period be reached earlier than the voltage ramp comes to the final
voltage level, the controller will significantly accelerate the ramp in order to converge to
the minimum operating voltage faster.
Once spin-up is finished, the controller will abandon the spin-up mode and switch into normal mode.

If the target commutation period could not be reached in the amount of time specified by
the parameter \CfgRef{mot+spup+to+ms}, in milliseconds, the controller will abort spin-up,
shut down the VSI and register it as a regular rotor stall event.

\subsubsection{Spin-up from non-stationary state}

Sapog assumes that the rotor is (nearly) stationary in the beginning of the spin-up process.
If this assumption is violated, there may be brief transient processes involving abnormal currents,
high vibrations and high EMI.

The transient currents can be either forward or regenerative, depending on whether the desired
and the actual directions of rotation match, and whether the initial guess of the current
commutation step was correct.

Typically Sapog can establish adequate synchronization in a few steps.
If the rotor was rotating in the same direction but at a higher speed,
it will be rapidly decelerated until the speed defined by the load and the source voltage is
reached.
If it is expected that the motor will be frequently started from non-stationary state,
it is recommended to either shorten the initial voltage ramp, or increase the initial
spin-up voltage, in order to reduce the stresses caused by initial braking.

\subsubsection{Configuration parameters}

This section summarizes information about the configuration parameters pertaining to the spin-up mode.
Read the preceding sections for a more detailed review.

\begin{itemize}
\item \CfgRef{mot+spup+blnk+pm} - duration of the extended blanking time during spin-up in permill
(i.e. one-thousands; $10\text{\space{}permill} = 1\% $) of the current commutation period.
\item \CfgRef{mot+spup+to+ms} - overall spin-up timeout, in milliseconds.
If spin-up could not be completed in this amount of time, the rotor will be considered stalled.
\item \CfgRef{mot+spup+st+cp} - maximum commutation period for spin-up mode, in microseconds.
This is also the initial commutation period.
\item \CfgRef{mot+spup+vramp+t} - duration of the initial voltage ramp, in seconds.
\item \CfgRef{mot+v+spinup} - initial source voltage $E_s$ in the beginning of the voltage ramp, in volts.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Open loop operation}\label{sec:open_loop}

While operating in the open loop mode, Sapog accepts setpoints in the range from 0\% to 100\%,
and treats that as the fraction of the inverter supply voltage $V_\text{inv}$ to
deliver to the motor $E_s$:
\begin{equation}
E_s = V_\text{inv}\cdot{}\mathrm{ramp}\left(\mathrm{limit}\left(S_\text{DC}\right)\right)
\qquad\text{for open loop mode}, S_\text{DC} \in \left(0, 1\right]
\end{equation}
where $S_\text{DC}$ is the setpoint (DC stands for \emph{duty cycle}),
$\mathrm{ramp}$ is the setpoint ramp function,
and $\mathrm{limit}$ is the speed limiting P-controller, reviewed below.

The ramp function replaces abrupt changes in the setpoint with gradual changes.
Abrupt changes that are small enough to not be a hazard to stability of the drive are
accepted by the controller directly, bypassing the ramp.
The following configuration parameters govern the open loop setpoint ramp:

\begin{itemize}
\item \CfgRef{mot+dc+slope} - the slope of the setpoint ramp, in full ranges per second.
For example, the value of 1 allows the controller to sweep the setpoint from 0\% to 100\% in 1 second.
The value of 10 allows the controller to sweep the setpoint from 0\% to 100\% in 0.1 seconds.
\item \CfgRef{mot+dc+accel} - the maximum change in setpoint that will be propagated directly,
bypassing the ramp.
For example, the value of 0.1 allows the controller to apply step changes up to 10\% large directly.
\end{itemize}

Increase the parameters (either one or both) to improve the response characteristics of the drive.
Reduce them if rapid setpoint changes cause stability issues.

Note that the minimum acceptable setpoint is constrained by the minimum duty cycle deduced from
the parameter \CfgRef{mot+v+min}.
If the setpoint falls into $\left(0, S_{\text{DC}_\text{min}}\right]$,
where $S_{\text{DC}_\text{min}}$ is the minimum
duty cycle deduced from the parameter \CfgRef{mot+v+min},
it will be silently overridden to $S_{\text{DC}_\text{min}}$.

The maximum acceptable setpoint will be automatically limited by means of a simple
P-controller\footnote{Proportional controller, i.e. only P term of a PID controller is implemented.}
if the motor approaches the maximum operating speed permitted by the
current PWM carrier frequency, as shown on the figure \ref{pwm_maximum_speed}.

A zero setpoint is treated as the command to stop the motor.
While the motor is stopped, the VSI is disabled, allowing the shaft to rotate freely.

\subsection{RPM control loop}

When operating in the RPM control mode, also known as RPM governor mode,
Sapog will try to maintain a specified mechanical speed.
Speed control is implemented by means of a parallel PID controller
that takes the current mechanical RPM as input and
produces the duty cycle setpoint at the output.

The nominal update rate of the PID controller $T_{\text{RPMPID}}$ is defined as follows:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:rpm_pid_control_loop_period}
T_{\text{RPMPID}} \approx \max \left(10^{-3},T_{\text{comm}}\right)
\end{equation}
where $T_\text{comm}$ is the current commutation period.
Update of the RPM control loop is not a hard real time process, and the software is allowed to
deviate.

RPM control loop relies on the duty cycle slope control function defined in the section \ref{sec:open_loop},
so the related configuration parameters are still applicable.
The speed limiting P-controller that is used in the open loop mode, however,
is entirely bypassed in RPM mode.
The maximum supported speed is dependent on the PWM carrier frequency;
see the figure \ref{pwm_maximum_speed} for details.
Equation \ref{eq:speed_electrical_mechanical} defines the relation between electrical
and mechanical angular rates.

If the commanded setpoint is lower than the value specified by the parameter \mbox{\CfgRef{mot+rpm+min},}
the actual setpoint will be silently increased to match this value.
A zero setpoint is treated as the command to stop the motor.
While the motor is stopped, the VSI is disabled, allowing the shaft to rotate freely.

The RPM PID controller does not wind up the integral term if the output is constrained by external factors,
such as:
\begin{itemize}
\item Duty cycle ramp.
\item Current limiting controller.
\item Maximum RPM limit.
\end{itemize}

The configuration parameters listed below govern operation of the RPM control loop.
The symbol $\text{DC}$ refers to the duty cycle unit ranging in $\left[-1, 1\right]$,
where negative values correspond to negative inverter source voltage $E_s$.

\begin{itemize}
\item \CfgRef{mot+num+poles} - the number of magnetic poles on the rotor, always even, always $\geq 2$.
This parameter is needed for the controller to convert the electrical speed $\text{RPM}_e$
into mechanical $\text{RPM}_m$.
\item \CfgRef{rpmctl+p} - proportional term of the RPM PID controller,
in $\frac{\text{DC}}{\text{RPM}_m}$.
\item \CfgRef{rpmctl+i} - integral term of the RPM PID controller,
in $\frac{\text{DC}}{\text{second}\cdot{}\text{RPM}_m}$.
\item \CfgRef{rpmctl+d} - derivative term of the RPM PID controller,
in $\frac{\text{second}\cdot{}\text{DC}}{\text{RPM}_m}$.
\item \CfgRef{mot+rpm+min} - minimum mechanical RPM at which stable operation is guaranteed.
\end{itemize}

The overall RPM control loop output for time step $n$ can be approximated with the following equations:
\begin{equation}
e(n) = \omega_{m_{n}} - S_{\omega_{m_{n}}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
E_{s_n} = V_{\text{inv}_n}\cdot\mathrm{ramp}
\left[
\underbrace{\frac{e\left(n\right) - e\left(n-1\right)}{T_{\text{RPMPID}}} \Pi_{\text{rpmctld}}}_\text{derivative} +
\mathrm{clamp}\left(\underbrace{\sum_{i=0}^n e\left(i\right) \Pi_{\text{rpmctli}}}_\text{integral}\right) +
\underbrace{e\left(n\right) \Pi_{\text{rpmctlp}}}_\text{proportional}
\right]
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\mathrm{ramp}$ - slope control function defined in the section \ref{sec:open_loop}.
\item $\mathrm{clamp}$ - integrator wind-up control function described in this section.
\item $\omega_{m}$ - current speed, in mechanical RPM.
\item $S_{\omega_{m}}$ - target speed setpoint, in mechanical RPM.
\item $T_{\text{RPMPID}}$ - instant control loop update period.
See equation \ref{eq:rpm_pid_control_loop_period}.
\item $\Pi_{\text{rpmctlp}}$ - proportional term of the PID controller.
\item $\Pi_{\text{rpmctli}}$ - integral term of the PID controller.
\item $\Pi_{\text{rpmctld}}$ - derivative term of the PID controller.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Current and voltage measurements}

\subsubsection{Measurement}

Sapog measures the DC inverter current $I_\text{inv}$ by means of a current shunt installed on the ground path,
the output of which is connected to the ADC via a current amplifier with a fixed gain coefficient of 10.

The resistance of the current shunt is specified via the configuration parameter \CfgRef{mot+i+shunt+mr},
in milliohms.

The inverter supply voltage $V_\text{inv}$ is measured through a resistor divider with the same
division ratio as that of the BEMF feedback circuits.
This division ratio is hard-coded per every supported hardware design and cannot be changed by the user.

Measurements of the inverter DC current $I_\text{inv}$ and voltage $V_\text{inv}$
are filtered with a first-order low-pass filter.
The corner frequency of the filter is specified by the parameter \CfgRef{mot+lpf+freq}, in hertz.

\subsubsection{Current limiting}

Sapog can limit the maximum DC bus current with the help of a simple P-controller
that activates when the instant current exceeds the limit.
The gain of the current limiting P-controller is specified via the configuration parameter
\CfgRef{mot+i+max+p}, in $\frac{\text{DC}}{ampere}$, where $\text{DC}$ is the duty cycle units
ranging in $\left[-1, 1\right]$.
The maximum current is specified via the configuration parameter \CfgRef{mot+i+max}, in amperes.

\section{Self diagnostics}

Sapog contains a set of diagnostic routines that can detect problems with the hardware.
The diagnostic routines are executed automatically at start up.
Additionally they can be run by external request.

While tests are executed, their progress and status information are printed to the CLI.
The user can understand the nature of detected failures by reading the printed test reports.

If at least one test fails at start-up, the controller will enter panic mode,
where it will remain until power cycled.
Learn more about this in the chapter \ref{sec:indication}.

\subsection{Power stage test}

During the power stage test, Sapog modulates a voltage sequence shown on the table below
and then validates the acquired BEMF samples.
The following legend applies:
\begin{itemize}
\item L - low voltage level. The low side transistor is constantly turned on.
\item H - high voltage level. A high duty cycle PWM is modulated on the phase.
\item F - the phase is floating. Both high and low transistors are turned off.
\end{itemize}

\begin{ZubaxCompactTable}{|c|c|c|c|}
    Step    & Phase A & Phase B & Phase C \\
    1       & L       & F       & F       \\
    2       & H       & F       & F       \\
    3       & F       & L       & F       \\
    4       & F       & H       & F       \\
    5       & F       & F       & L       \\
    6       & F       & F       & H       \\
\end{ZubaxCompactTable}

The voltage at the output of the BEMF feedback circuits is sampled once for each non-floating phase;
which produces six samples $Q_1 \ldots Q_6$.
Then the following assertions are verified:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
&Q_1 < L \\
&Q_3 < L \\
&Q_5 < L \\
&Q_2 \approx Q_4 \approx Q_6
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $L$ is a specific lower threshold defined by the hardware implementation,
typically at the level corresponding to 5\% of the dynamic range of BEMF.

The test is considered passed only of all assertions are true.
It is easy to see that this test is invariant to the fact whether the motor is connected or not.

Malfunctions in the following components may cause this test to fail:
\begin{itemize}
\item VSI transistors.
\item VSI transistor drivers.
\item PWM module of the microcontroller.
\item BEMF feedback circuits.
\item ADC module of the microcontroller.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Phase cross-conductivity test}

The cross-conductivity test allows the controller to detect short-circuits between any of the three
phases or their BEMF feedback circuits.
During this test, the sequence shown in the table below is modulated at the output of the VSI.
The following legend applies:
\begin{itemize}
\item H - high voltage level. A high duty cycle PWM is modulated on the phase.
\item F - the phase is floating. Both high and low transistors are turned off.
\end{itemize}

\begin{ZubaxCompactTable}{|c|c|c|c|}
    Step    & Phase A & Phase B & Phase C \\
    1       & H       & F       & F       \\
    2       & F       & H       & F       \\
    3       & F       & F       & H       \\
\end{ZubaxCompactTable}

At each step, voltages of all three phases are sampled, which yields the set of samples shown in the next table.
It is assumed that phases that are floating will be pulled down by the resistor dividers in the BEMF feedback
circuits.

\begin{ZubaxCompactTable}{|c|c|c|c|}
    Step    & Phase A & Phase B & Phase C \\
    1       &$Q_{1A}$ &$Q_{1B}$ &$Q_{1C}$  \\
    2       &$Q_{2A}$ &$Q_{2B}$ &$Q_{2C}$  \\
    3       &$Q_{3A}$ &$Q_{3B}$ &$Q_{3C}$  \\
\end{ZubaxCompactTable}

The following assertions are then validated:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
&Q_{1A} > H \qquad{} Q_{1B} < L \qquad{} Q_{1C} < L \\
&Q_{2A} < L \qquad{} Q_{2B} > H \qquad{} Q_{2C} < L \\
&Q_{3A} < L \qquad{} Q_{3B} < L \qquad{} Q_{3C} > H \\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $H$ and $L$ are arbitrary hardware-defined thresholds, high and low, respectively.

Failure of at least one assertion against $H$ indicates that the corresponding phase
or its BEMF feedback circuits are not functioning correctly.
Failure of at least one assertion against $L$ indicates that there is a short circuit between
the current high phase and the phase of the column of the failed assertion.

It is easy to see that the test will always be failing if the motor is connected.
Sapog can recognize that the motor is connected by observing all phases shorted,
in which case the results of this test will be discarded and the test will be considered passed.

\subsection{Inverter voltage and current feedback test}

Over the course of this test, Sapog merely verifies that the measurements reported by the
current and voltage measurement blocks are sane and fall within the expected ranges,
which are hardware-defined.

This test can detect issues with the respective measurement circuits,
ADC, and the power supply of the microcontroller.

\subsection{Temperature monitoring}

Sapog periodically queries a digital temperature sensor installed on the power stage.
This information is reported outside via communication interfaces, but not used
by Sapog itself.

\chapter{Indication}\label{sec:indication}

Sapog is equipped with means of visual and audial indication that are reviewed in this chapter.

\section{RGB LED}

The RGB LED is used to indicate the status of the firmware,
the status of the bootloader while it is running,
or it can be controlled externally via one of the available communication interfaces.
In the latter case, the status indication output is overridden in favor of the externally
received indication commands.

\newcommand{\ShowSolidColor}[1]{%
{\color{#1}\rule{0.4em}{0.8em}\rule{0.4em}{0.8em}\rule{0.4em}{0.8em}\rule{0.4em}{0.8em}\rule{0.4em}{0.8em}}%
}
\newcommand{\ShowBlinkingColor}[1]{{%
\color{#1}\rule{0.4em}{0.8em}%
\color{black}\rule{0.4em}{0.8em}%
\color{#1}\rule{0.4em}{0.8em}%
\color{black}\rule{0.4em}{0.8em}%
\color{#1}\rule{0.4em}{0.8em}%
}}

\subsection{Firmware status indication}

While the firmware is running, the following LED colors can be used to reflect its status.

\begin{ZubaxSimpleTable}{Firmware status indication via RGB LED}{|l l|X|}
    State            &                         & Meaning \\
    Solid white      & \ShowSolidColor{lightgray}& Initialization is in progress, not ready to work yet. \\
    Solid green      & \ShowSolidColor{green}  & Functioning normally. \\
    Blinking cyan    & \ShowBlinkingColor{cyan}& UAVCAN auto-enumeration is in progress, awaiting user input. \\
    Solid yellow     & \ShowSolidColor{yellow} & Controller is locked (see section \ref{sec:stall_detection}),
                                                 or the temperature sensor is malfunctioning. \\
    Solid red        & \ShowSolidColor{red}    & Fatal error, or self test failure.
                                                 Use CLI to obtain detailed info. \\
\end{ZubaxSimpleTable}

\subsection{Bootloader status indication}

The bootloader is started immediately after the device is powered on.
It runs for several seconds, and then, unless there is no valid firmware image
or update of the firmware is requested, the bootloader starts the firmware.
More information on the bootloader is available in the section \ref{sec:bootloader}.

While the bootloader is running, the following LED behaviors are defined.

\begin{ZubaxSimpleTable}{Bootloader status indication via RGB LED}{|l l|X|}
    State            &                         & Meaning \\
    Solid red        & \ShowSolidColor{red}    & Error. Possible reasons: could not erase the old
                                                 firmware image; the file server returned an invalid
                                                 or unexpected response; file server response has timed
                                                 out; the CRC of the firmware image is invalid. \\
    Solid white      & \ShowSolidColor{lightgray}& Just started, initialization is in progress.
                                                 This state is very transient. \\
    Solid yellow     & \ShowSolidColor{yellow} & CAN auto bit rate detection. \\
    Solid green      & \ShowSolidColor{green}  & CAN auto bit rate detection finished.
                                                 This state is very transient. \\
    Solid magenta    & \ShowSolidColor{magenta}& UAVCAN dynamic node ID allocation started. \\
    Solid blue       & \ShowSolidColor{blue}   & UAVCAN dynamic node ID allocation finished. \\
    Solid cyan       & \ShowSolidColor{cyan}   & Firmware image is being downloaded. \\
    Off              & \ShowSolidColor{black}  & The application is being started. \\
\end{ZubaxSimpleTable}

\subsection{External control}

The RGB LED can be controlled by external commands via the available communication interfaces.
External control overrides the state indication capabilities of the LED.

\section{Sound}

Sapog can modulate arbitrary sounds by applying specific low-power voltage patterns on the motor windings.
Induced currents cause the windings to vibrate, which produces audible sounds at the frequency of the
applied voltage.

This feature can be invoked by external command via communication interfaces.

At start up, Sapog generates two short beeps with the following parameters:
frequency 1 kHz, duration 100 ms each, spacing 200 ms.

\begin{ZubaxSimpleTable}{Sound modulation capabilities}{|X|c c|l|}
    Parameter                            & Min & Max  & Unit \\
    Audio frequency                      & 100 & 5000 & Hz \\
    Duration of modulated sound          & 1   & 100  & ms \\
\end{ZubaxSimpleTable}

If the requested parameters fall outside the limits specified in the table,
Sapog will automatically constrain the parameters in order to produce the closest achievable results.

\chapter{Configuration parameters}

This chapter summarizes all configuration parameters available in Sapog.

\section{Non-volatile configuration storage}

All configuration parameters are stored in a non-volatile memory
that retains its contents across power cycles.

Modification of any single parameter will trigger Sapog to commit all of them into the non-volatile
memory one second after the last modification has taken place.
The one second delay ensures that no excessive modifications of the non-volatile memory will be carried out.

Sapog will not write or erase the non-volatile memory as long as the motor is running, in order to
avoid interference with the hard real time motor control algorithms.
If configuration was changed while the motor is running,
a write operation will be scheduled and postponed until the motor is stopped.
