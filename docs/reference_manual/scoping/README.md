Annotated oscillograms
======================

This is how these images were made:

1. Scope the necessary signals using Saleae Logic or any other oscilloscope capable of exporting data in CSV.
2. Using Wolfram Mathematica and the included notebook, plot the data from the CSV file and adjust it as necessary.
3. Export the plot from Mathematica into an EPS file (Encapsulated PostScript).
4. Using Inkscape, open the exported EPS file and add annotations manually.
Don't forget to save the annotated file into the Inkscape SVG format for future adjustments, shall that be needed.
Use extension `*.inkscape.svg` for clarity.
5. Export the annotated image into an EPS file.
6. Include the final EPS into the document.

If the image requires no annotations, steps 4~5 can be skipped.
